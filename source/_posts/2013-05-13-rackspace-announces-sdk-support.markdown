Over on the [Rackspace Blog](http://www.rackspace.com/blog) we've announced that we are now offering support to developers writing applications on our cloud infrastructure:

> We take support pretty seriously around here.  Our philosophy has been to include super valuable and responsive support with all our offers.  For example, when you’re a customer and find out you’re going on national TV to pitch your product, we’ll be there to help with architecting and operating the situation at no additional cost.  This is clearly not the standard in the cloud space where even the most basic support costs a lot more on top of core cloud costs.  We are ready to take this already high standard to a new level.  

> I would like to announce that we are launching Rackspace Developer Support, which marks the first time we will officially support your application code.  When you’re programming your application to interact with the Rackspace Cloud powered by OpenStack, we want to make sure it is as easy as possible.  That is why over the past several months, we have been in the process of releasing a series of Software Development Kits in the world’s most popular programming languages.  Right now, this includes PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, and .Net.  We are also working on node.js, which we hope to release soon.
